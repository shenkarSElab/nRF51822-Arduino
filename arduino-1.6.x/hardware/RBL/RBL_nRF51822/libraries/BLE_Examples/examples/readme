using redBear and nrf24 based beacons for proximity detetcion derived from RSSI signal


BLE_ScanReport[1] sits on the Readbear module. 
Readbears job is to scan beacons and pass them on.  
its connected over serial (TX only) to a nano running BLE_ScanReport-nano[2], which does little but handle the RSSI distance estimation code.  

the other nano bitbangs the nrf24, BLE_nrf24Beacon code[3], which has its own pcb[5] :)


it might be better to merge to one nano, seems possible.

code can be found on our fork[4], 
but its best to install the main branch if you are going to reflash the redBear
